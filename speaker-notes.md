## 01: Basics of JavaScript, what can go wrong and how to fix it
## 02: What is JavaScript?
Often abbreviated JS

Learning programming is a bit like learning how to ride a bike -- you're not going to be good at it by watching diagrams of how a bike and balance works. Practice regularly!
JS different from Java despite the name. The syntax is similar but a lot of the concepts are extremely different.

This oversimplifies a lot of things, newer versions of JS have new features and we will skim over some concepts

## 03: What is a program?
## 04: What can you do with JavaScript?
## 05: Instructions
## 06: Variables
Keywords in ES6: let, const but we won't talk about them for simplicity
Strings: use quotes to delimitate what's code, and what's in the text
You can mix types but it might have odd consequences, eg try adding "5" + "3" and 5+3

## 12: Manipulating HTML from JavaScript: objects
Not going to expand on everything but some objects are always going to have the same properties: first example we could have person1 and person2 and we would only have to define the sendMessage() method once

Same for HTML objects, they will always have the same properties
