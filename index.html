    Get out the rice cooker
    Fill it with rice
    Fill it with water
    Cook the rice
    Chop the vegetables
    Stir-fry the vegetables
    Taste-test the vegetables
        If the veggies are good
            Remove them from the stove
        If the veggies aren't good
            Add more pepper and spices
        If the veggies aren't cooked enough
            Keep stir-frying the veggies
    Heat the tortilla
    Add rice to tortilla
    Add vegetables to tortilla
    Roll tortilla

                <h2>What can you do with JavaScript?</h2>

                <p>The most interesting part of JavaScript is that it allows us to manipulate HTML and CSS in real time, and react to events in the browser. Check out the example below:</p>

                <button>A magic button</button>

                <div class="toggled-box red">This box is red</div>
                <pre>&lt;div class="<mark>red</mark>"&gt;This box is <mark>red</mark>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

                <h3>We are doing two things here:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>listen to the <code>click</code> event</strong> on the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element, and run some code when it is clicked</li>
                    <li>that code <strong>manipulates the HTML of our box</strong> to change the value of its <code>class</code> attribute, and the text it contains.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Of course, <strong>this is a simplistic example</strong>, but you can do very complex things with JavaScript, such as loading content in real-time from a server without reloading the entire page, manipulating strings of text, hiding and showing elements on the page (e.g. menus, accordions), create custom interactive widgets, react to user input (keyboard, mouse and touch)&hellip;</p>

                <p>When used correctly, JavaScript can greatly enhance the user experience. But if some users are not taken into consideration, <strong>it can make their experience worse</strong>. In the example above, we don't have live regions, so screen reader users are not aware that the text in the box has changed when they press the button. Another common occurence is working only with a mouse or touch, but not keyboard.</p>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>

                <p>Below this paragraph is a console, which allows you to type some JavaScript code and immediately get the result. Try some simple instructions like <code>5&nbsp;+&nbsp;3</code>, or <code>40&nbsp;*&nbsp;28000</code>. To deal with text, you have to wrap it with quotations marks, <code>"like&nbsp;this"</code>. You can concatenate (add) two strings of text with the <code>+</code> operator: try it!</p>

                <div class="console-container">
                    <div class="console"></div>
                </div>

                <h2>Variables</h2>

                <p>In programming we use a lot of <strong>variables</strong>. These are keywords that retain a certain value, and allows us to avoid duplication, or take data set by the user. Variables, as their name indicate, can change value. Initialise a variable for the first time with the <code>var</code> keyword, followed by its name, then its value. For example <code>var&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;4</code>.</p>

                <p>You can change the value of a variable that's already been declared with the <code>=</code> operator. You can then use them in place of a number, for example <code>x + 5</code>.</p>

                <div class="console-container">
                    <div class="console"></div>
                </div>

                <p>Variables can take many possible type of values, for instance:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Numbers: for example <code>42</code> or <code>5.2</code></li>
                    <li>Strings: chains of characters surrounded by quotations marks, for example <code>"apples"</code></li>
                    <li>Boolean: this is either the values <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. This is used very often for making logical statements and conditions; and remembering the <strong>state</strong> of something (for example "pressed or not").</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Try declaring multiple variable and adding them.</p>
            </article>

            <article hidden id="example-controlflow">
                <h2>Conditions</h2>

                <p>An important part of programming is having a <strong>control flow</strong>. This is where our program can make <strong>decisions</strong>. The most common way to do this is with an <strong>if-else</strong> statement.</p>

                <pre>If <mark>condition</mark> is true, <em>then</em>
    do something
else
    do something else
</pre>

                <p>Let's have an example. We will set a variable using the box below, to see if someone is over 18:</p>

                <p><code>var age = </code><input type="number" name="value" length="3" value="15"><code>;</code></p>

                <pre>if(age >= 18) {
    <mark id="if-true">message = "You are an adult!";</mark>
} else {
    <mark id="if-false">message = "Hang on there kiddo, you can't buy alcohol";</mark>
}</pre>

                <p aria-live="polite"><code>message = <span id="message-result"></span></code></p>

                <p>You can have other conditions with several "else if" nested together. It is also possible to have logical operators like "and" &amp; "or" to combine multiple statements in the same condition. @TODO</p>
